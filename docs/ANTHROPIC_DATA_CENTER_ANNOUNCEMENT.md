## 📋 Key Commitments

### 1. Cover Infrastructure Costs
- Pay for 100% of grid infrastructure upgrades (transmission lines, substations)
- These costs will NOT be passed on to consumers
- Anthropic will absorb costs via increased monthly electricity charges

### 2. Procure New Power
- Bring net-new power generation online to match data center needs
- Where new generation isn't online yet, work with utilities to estimate and cover demand-driven price effects

### 3. Reduce Grid Strain
- Invest in curtailment systems (cut power usage during peak demand)
- Deploy grid optimization tools
- Both keep prices lower for ratepayers

### 4. Invest in Local Communities
- Create hundreds of permanent jobs + thousands of construction jobs
- Deploy water-efficient cooling technologies
- Partner with local leaders on AI benefit-sharing initiatives

**Dario Amodei (Anthropic CEO):**
> "Building AI responsibly can't stop at the technology — it has to extend to the infrastructure behind it. We've been clear that the U.S. needs to build AI infrastructure at scale to stay competitive, but the costs of powering our models should fall on Anthropic, not everyday Americans."

## 📊 The Problem Being Addressed

### Data Center Energy Impact:
- **Current:** Data centers use ~4.4% of US electricity
- **Projected 2028:** Could surge to 12%
- **Price Impact:** Electricity prices could increase 25% in markets with many data centers by 2030 (Carnegie Mellon/NC State study)

### Political Pressure:
- **New York:** Bill introduced to pause data center permits (Feb 7, 2026)
- **Federal:** Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) introduced bill requiring AI corps to pay for electricity costs + grid infrastructure (Jan 2026)

## 🎯 How to Use This in Council Simulator

### NIMBY Argument Pattern:
> "Data centers will raise our electricity bills by 25%! We can't afford this!"

### Petitioner Rebuttal (Using This Data):
> "I understand your concern about electricity costs. However, Anthropic announced this week—February 11th—that they will cover 100% of consumer price increases caused by their data centers. This includes paying for all grid infrastructure upgrades and bringing new power generation online. This isn't theoretical—it's a binding corporate commitment. OpenAI and Microsoft have made the same pledge. Your electricity bills will remain steady."

## 📝 Submission Messaging

### For Written Summary:
> "On February 11, 2026—during this hackathon—Anthropic announced they would cover consumer electricity price increases from their data centers. This is exactly the kind of real-time information Council Simulator delivers to petitioners. NIMBYs oppose data centers based on outdated fears. Our system ensures petitioners have the latest data, corporate commitments, and policy changes to make informed, fact-based arguments at city council meetings."

### For README:
> **Why This Matters:** Data center debates are happening RIGHT NOW. New York just introduced legislation to pause permits. Federal bills are being proposed. And this week, Anthropic made a landmark commitment to cover consumer electricity costs. Council Simulator ensures petitioners have this critical information when they walk into that council meeting.
